      // AVERAGE CALCULATOR MARK III // 
      
      // NOTES //
      This was coded in C#
      The code editor used is Visual Studio Code 
      This is just a test repository for an average calculator, you could use it if you want but it has some errors (it still works)
      
      // OTHER INFORMATION // 
      In all therory, this should work if you have the correct things installed (for C#)
      I mean, this is just a test and it worked for me.
      
      You can change anything in the "Change The Appearence" part, other than that, maybe its better if you dont touch anything unless you know what your doing.
